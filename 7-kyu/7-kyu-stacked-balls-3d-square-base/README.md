# Stacked Balls - 3D (square base)

### Description:

I have stacked some cannon balls in a square pyramid.

Given the number of layers of my stack, what is the total height?

Return the height as multiple of the ball diameter.

### Example

The image above shows a stack of 4 layers.

### Notes

layers >= 0
approximate answers (within 0.001) are good enough
